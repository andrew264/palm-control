# palm-control

This is a simple python script that uses the `mediapipe` library to detect the hand and fingers and control the mouse pointer using the palm and fingers.

# TODO (what I think I need to do)
 - [x] use mediapipe to get hand cords (easy)
 - [x] use Kalman filtering to smooth the outputs (kinda easy)
 - [ ] using something like a lstm model to find future outputs (high polling rate) ?? (Should be doable?)
 - [ ] map them fingers to mouse cursor movements (the hard part)
 - [ ] profit ??
